/**
 * Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to
 * convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in
 * their study.
 * Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
 * ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
 * 
 * 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the
 * dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
 * humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.
 * 
 * 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same
 * as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
 * 
 * 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already
 * know from other challenges how we calculate averages ðŸ˜‰)
 * 
 * 4. Run the function for both test datasets
 * 
 * TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
 * TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
