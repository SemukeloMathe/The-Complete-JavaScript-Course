/**
 * 1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a
 * CHILD "class" of Car. Besides make and currentspeed, the EV also has the
 * current battery charge in % ("charge" property).
 * 2. Implement a "chargeBattery" method which takes an argument "chargeTo" and
 * sets the battery charge to "chargeTo".
 * 3. Implement an "accelerate" method that will increase the car's speed by 20
 * and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: "Tesla going at
 * 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%".
 * 4. Create an electric car object & experiment with calling "accelerator",
 * "brake", & "chargeBattery" (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you
 * "accelerate"!
 *
 * CAR DATA 1: "Tesla" going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%
