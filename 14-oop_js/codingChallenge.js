/**
 * 1. Use a contsructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a
 * speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h.
 * 2. Implement an "accelerate" method that will increase the car's speed by 10
 * and log the new speed to the console.
 * 3. Implement a "brake" method that will decrease the car's speed by 5 and
 * log the new speed to the console.
 * 4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling "accelerate" and "brake"
 * multiple times on each of them.
 *
 * CAR DATA 1: "BMW" going at 120km/h
 * CAR DATA 2: "Mercedes" going at 95km/h
