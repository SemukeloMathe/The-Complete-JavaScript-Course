# ðŸ“š Course: The Complete JavaScript Course

This repository documents my journey through [The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
It is a comprehensive and highly-rated course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The course is designed to take learners from the `fundamentals` to `advanced` concepts of the `JavaScript programming language`. 
It equips them with the skills needed to build modern, interactive web applications.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Learning

* **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and strings.

* **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**: Arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest operators, default parameters, optional chaining, and more.

* **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting, modifying, and creating elements, handling events, and dynamically updating the UI to create interactive experiences.

* **Advanced Concepts**: Closures, the 'this' keyword, higher-order functions, and functional programming techniques.

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Prototypal inheritance, constructor functions, ES6 classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

* **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX, and working with APIs.

* **Developer Skills**: Problem-solving, debugging, code architecture, and using modern tools like NPM, Parcel, Babel, and ES6 modules.

* **Hands-On Practice**: Engaging in over 50 coding challenges and assignments to reinforce learning.

* **Real-World Projects**: Building six projects that simulate real-world applications.
