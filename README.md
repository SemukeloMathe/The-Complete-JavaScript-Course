# ðŸ“š Course: The Complete JavaScript Course

This repository documents my journey through [The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), a comprehensive and highly-rated course by Jonas Schmedtmann. The course is designed to take learners from the fundamentals of JavaScript to advanced concepts, equipping them with the skills needed to build modern, interactive applications.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Learning

* **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and strings.
* **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**: Arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest operators, default parameters, optional chaining, and more.
* **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting, modifying, and creating elements, handling events, and dynamically updating the UI to create interactive experiences.
* **Advanced Concepts**: Closures, the 'this' keyword, higher-order functions, and functional programming techniques.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Prototypal inheritance, constructor functions, ES6 classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX, and working with APIs.
* **Real-World Projects**: Building six portfolio-worthy projects that simulate real-world applications.
* **Developer Skills**: Problem-solving, debugging, code architecture, and using modern tools like NPM, Parcel, Babel, and ES6 modules.
* **Hands-On Practice**: Engaging in over 50 coding challenges and assignments to reinforce learning.
