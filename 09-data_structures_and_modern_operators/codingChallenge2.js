/**
 * Let's continue with our football betting app!
 *
 * 1. Loop over the "game.scored" array and print each player name to the
 * console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
 *
 * 2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console
 * (We already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't
 * remember)
 *
 * 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly
 * like this:
 *      Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
 *      Odd of draw: 3.25
 *      Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.
 *
 * Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
 * (except for "draw"). HINT: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
 * same property names ðŸ˜‰
 *
 * BONUS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
 * players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value.
 * In this game, it will look like this:
 *      { Gnarby: 1, Hummels: 1, Lewandowski: 2 }
